## Description

Weather application that is inspired by Apple Weather application. I wonted to create a project where I will be able to practise my Android dev skills. I had an idea to clone the iPhone Weather app because I could practise many aspects of app development. I managed to clone most of the iPhone app features. The biggest difference is in UI elements like icons or backgrounds images.

## Demo

## Build guide

To build this project the best option is to use Android Studio. Clone the repository and you are almost ready. The application uses [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and in the project folder, you need to add the file with API credentials `project/apicredentials.properties` with the following text:

```properties
key="..."
```

To generate a key create a free acount on [OpenWearher site](https://openweathermap.org/i). Affter all of the project is ready to be built.
