## Description

Weather application that is inspired by Apple Weather application. I wanted to create a project where I will be able to practise my Android dev skills. I had an idea to clone the iPhone Weather app because I could practise many aspects of app development. I managed to clone most of the iPhone app features. The biggest difference is in UI elements like icons or backgrounds images.
